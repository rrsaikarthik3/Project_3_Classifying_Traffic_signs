## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Overview
---
In this project, German Traffic sign images are trained and validated using Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks a model so that it can classify traffic sign images  After the model was trained, the model was tested on new test images.

More details of the project are found on the writeup file named 'Traffic_Signs_Writeup.md'
The intermediate images saved in order to pre-process or learn more about the training sets are present under examples folder
The main project file is : Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
